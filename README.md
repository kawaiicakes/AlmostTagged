An addon for [Almost Unified] to let preferred items inherit tags.

</div>

## **üìñ Information**
*More README updates coming soon!* <br>
This is a simple addon for [Almost Unified] allowing preferred items to inherit tags from the items they replace. RegEx exclusion of items/tags via a config is included. Please see the ~~wiki~~ for more information.<br><br>
It was written before native implementation of this feature for my upcoming modpack, _AshleyCraft,_ for Minecraft 1.19.2. <br><br>
It's likely that in the near future (as of 9 July 2023) that the [Almost Reliable] team will make this a native feature of Almost Unified.

## **üîß Manual Installation**
1. Download the latest **mod jar** from the ~~releases, CurseForge, or Modrinth~~.
2. Install Minecraft [Forge].
3. Drop the **jar file** into your mods folder. Easy peezy lemon squeezy
